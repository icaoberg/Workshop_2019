# BioNetGen
## Repository for BioNetGen models, descriptions, and code to be used for the 2019 Workshop.

Materials for the BioNetGen portion of the workshop are available [here](https://github.com/RuleWorld/BNGTutorial/blob/master/README.md).

## Requirements

If you are using your own laptop, install RuleBender 2.3.0, which is available at http://bionetgen.org. If you are attending the workshop in person you will be able to use one of the computers in the lab and don't need to install the software beforehand.
